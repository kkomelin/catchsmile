Catch a Smile Drupal 7 module (demo project for DrupalConf Moscow 2012)

I developed it for my presentation at DrupalConf Moscow 2012 (02.06.2012).
Feel free to contact with me using http://komelin.com/contact if you have any questions.

The module contains:
1) Views plugin for Catch a Smile Photo Gallery.
2) Web service that calculates count of catchsmile nodes.
3) JavaScript code that performs page refreshing if count of catchsmile nodes is changed.

Dependencies:
views (3.x)
lightbox2
services (3.x)

I provide the module "AS IS" without any warranty.
Probably GitHub is temporary storage for this module because of drupal rules.
